# The Model View Controller (MVC) Pattern

GET /about HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1

"GET for the /about route"

## Routes

Matches for the URL that is requested

"GET for the /about route"

I see you requested /about, we'll give that to the about AboutController to handle

## Models

Database wrapper

User Model

- Query for records
- Wrap individual records

## Views

Your response body content

- HTML
- CSV
- PDF
- XML

This is what gets sent back to the browser and displayed

## Controllers

Decide how to process a request and define a response

- Decide where things go
